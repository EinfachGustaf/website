# Security Policy

## Introduction

The security of our users is important to the people of the EinfachGustaf.live project. \
This Security Policy will show you how to properly report security vulnerabilities in our code.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the code of [our website](https://einfachgustaf.live), we ask you to NOT report how to abuse it, giving in-depth explanation of the vulnerability or other information, which can be potentially dangerous to other users in PUBLIC chats, issues, pull requests, discussions or other. You only should report security vulnerabilities to the [EinfachGustaf.live Support](https://einfachgustaf.live/contact). \
\
Please consider, that if you have found a dangerous vulnerability and not reporting it properly, you can risk other users privacy or more/other and the longer a vulnerability exists, the higher is the chance, that someone will abuse it.

## Ending Words

Please respect other users by reporting security vulnerabilites and stay safe!
